You really should get off that stupid platform that promotes the absence of thinking in 280 characters.

There is **nothing** of value that can be said in such a short format, its only a slogan.

And don't get me started on the nazi in chief who uses that for political interference and insider trading.

Seriously, do a favor for your brain.
