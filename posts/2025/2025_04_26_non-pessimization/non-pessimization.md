Sorry, I am not sorry about the orthographic pun.

Layout:

The dude is absolutely right on non-pessimization
worst code ever is infinitely more complex to debug, run fast or maintain
The is an upper limit to the extent you can optimize your code but there is no limit to how slow you can make your code run

A clear practical example with BigQuery: infinite scalability, and infinite parallelization
And still it can run extremely slow


## The Staggering Difference Of People That Have A General Idea Of How Their Code Run


## You Should Know A Bit Of Assembly

Not too difficult, useful, and you really understand how things run.
